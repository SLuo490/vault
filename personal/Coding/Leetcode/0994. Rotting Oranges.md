## Description
You are given an `m x n` `grid` where each cell can have one of three values:

- `0` representing an empty cell,
- `1` representing a fresh orange, or
- `2` representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is **4-directionally adjacent** to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return _the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange_. If _this is impossible, return_ `-1`.

### Example 1:
![[Pasted image 20250415103957.png]]
```
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: grid = [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
```

### Constraints:
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10`
- `grid[i][j]` is `0`, `1`, or `2`.
## Solutions

### Solution 1: BFS (Level Order Traversal)

Initialize the count of fresh oranges, add all rotten oranges' position in grid into a queue, and define 4 directional movement array to traverse in queue. 

Process the queue level by level where each level is one minute. For each rotten orange, check all 4 adjacent cells. If a fresh orange is found, mark it as rotten, decrement the fresh orange count, and add the new rotten orange into queue. 

After processing an entire level increment minutes. 

If there is still a fresh orange, return -1, else return the minutes that has passed. 

**Time Complexity**: `O(m * n)`
**Space Complexity**: `O(m * n)`

```cpp

    int orangesRotting(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int freshOranges = 0, minutes = 0; 
        queue<pair<int, int>> q; 
        
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 2) {
                    q.push({i, j}); 
                } else if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    freshOranges++; 
                }
            }
        }

        vector<vector<int>> directions = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}}; 
        while (!q.empty()) {
            // need to traverse the q in a level order
            int levelSize = q.size(); 

            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
                int x = q.front().first; 
                int y = q.front().second; 
                q.pop(); 

                for (vector<int> dir : directions) {
                    int newX = x + dir[0];
                    int newY = y + dir[1]; 

                    if (newX >= 0 && newY >= 0 && newX < grid.size() && newY < grid[0].size() && grid[newX][newY] == 1) {
                        freshOranges--; 
                        // update the fresh orange to rotten orange
                        grid[newX][newY] = 2; 
                        q.push({newX, newY}); 
                    }
                }
            }
            if (!q.empty()) minutes++; 
        }
        return freshOranges > 0 ? -1 : minutes; 
    }
