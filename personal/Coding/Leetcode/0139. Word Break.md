## Description
Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return `true` if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

**Note** that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 300`
- `1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20`
- `s` and `wordDict[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of `wordDict` are **unique**.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Set + DP
We can use a add all the words in `wordDict` into a set and use a DP array. 
We then check if a substring in `s` contains the word in set by looping from `j to i` in a nested loop. 

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool wordBreak(string s, vector<string>& wordDict) {
        unordered_set<string> words(wordDict.begin(), wordDict.end()); 
        vector<bool> dp(s.length() + 1); 
        dp[0] = true; 

        for (int i = 1; i <= s.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (dp[j] && words.count(s.substr(j, i - j))) {
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break;  
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[s.length()]; 
    }
};
```

### Solution 2: Trie + DP
We can use a combination of [[trie]] and [[dp]]. 
* **Trie**: Efficient word lookup
* **Dynamic Programming**: Track which substrings can be formed

Build a trie from all the words in the dictionary for efficient prefix matching. Then create a DP array where `dp[i]` indicates whether substring `s[0...i - 1]` can be segmented. Initialize the `dp[0]` to be true as empty string can always be segmented. 

For each position `i` where `dp[i]` is true:
- Try to match dictionary words starting at position `i`
- Use the Trie to efficiently check if any word matches
- When a complete word is found ending at position `j` mark `dp[j + 1] = true`

Return `dp[s.length()]` which indicate whether the entire string can be segmented. 

**Time Complexity**: `O(n^2)`
**Space Complexity**: `O(n + m)`
- `O(n)` for the dp array
- `O(m)` for the trie

#### Solution 1: Walk through

```
Example: 
input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
output: false
```

**Build a trie:**
```
					-
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
n	a o                             a
d	t g                             n
    s                               d

Note: each children node also has children[26] from a - z
```

**Initialize a DP array:** 
```
dp: [T, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F]
```

**Process string:** 
Starting at index 0 (`dp[0]` is true):

- We check for words starting at index 0:
    - Following "c" → "a" → "t" in the Trie, we find "cat" is a complete word
    - So we set `dp[3]` = true (indicating "cat" can be formed)
    - Following "c" → "a" → "t" → "s" in the Trie, we find "cats" is a complete word
    - So we set `dp[4]` = true (indicating "cats" can be formed)
    - We can't form any longer words starting at index 0

Starting at index 3 (`dp[3]` is true):

- We check for words starting at index 3:
    - Following "s" → "a" → "n" → "d" in the Trie, we find "sand" is a complete word
    - So we set `dp[7]` = true (indicating "cat" + "sand" can be formed)
    - We can't form any longer words starting at index 3

Starting at index 4 (`dp[4]` is true):

- We check for words starting at index 4:
    - Following "a" → "n" → "d" in the Trie, we find "and" is a complete word
    - So we set `dp[7]` = true (indicating "cats" + "and" can be formed)
    - We can't form any longer words starting at index 4

Starting at index 7 (`dp[7]` is true):

- We check for words starting at index 7:
    - Following "o" → "g" in the Trie, we find there's no match for "og"
    - We can't form any words starting at index 7

```
Final DP Array:

Position:   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
String:     -   c   a   t   s   a   n   d   o   g
dp[]:      [T] [F] [F] [T] [T] [F] [F] [T] [F] [F]
```

                if (node->children[curr] == nullptr) break;

                if (node->isWord) {

                }
            }
        }

        return dp[s.length()]; 
    }
