## Description
You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
### Example 1:
```
**Input:** coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```
### Example 2:
```
**Input:** coins = [2], amount = 3
**Output:** -1
```
### Constraints:
```
- `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1`
- `0 <= amount <= 104`
```

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Dynamic Programming

Initialize a DP array of size `amount + 1` where each index represents an amount we want to make. The value of each index is the minimum number of coins needed to make the amount. 

Set the first index to 0, since 0 coins are needed to make amount 0. 

We then iterate through the amounts from 1 to the target amount, and for each amount we try every coin denomination in the array `[1, 2, 5]`

If a coin can be used (coin value <= current amount) then update the minimum coins needed. The formula is `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)`

```
ex: [1, 2, 5], amount = 11

dp[0] = 0

dp[1] = min(dp[1], 1 + dp[1 - 1]) = 1
	  = min(dp[1], 1 + dp[2 - 1]) (X) -- doesn't satisfy (i - coin >= 0)

dp[2] = min(dp[2], 1 + dp[2 - 1]) = 2
	  = min(dp[2], 1 + dp[2 - 2]) = 1
	  = min(dp[3], 1 + dp[5 - 2]) (X) -- doesn't satisfy (i - coin >= 0)

dp[3] = min(dp[3], 1 + dp[3 - 1]) = 2
	  = min(dp[3], 1 + dp[3 - 2]) = 2
	  = min(dp[3], 1 + dp[3 - 5]) (x) -- doesn't satisfy (i - coin >= 0)

...

dp[11] = min(dp[11], 1 + dp[11 - 1])
	   = min(dp[11], 1 + dp[11 - 2])
	   = min(dp[11], 1 + dp[11 - 5])

for each dp, we get the min value between all three options
```

**Time Complexity**: `O(amount * len(coins))`
**Space Complexity**: `O(amount)`

#### C++
```cpp
int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
	vector<int> dp(amount + 1, amount + 1); 
	dp[0] = 0; 

	for (int i = 1; i < amount + 1; i++) {
		for (int coin : coins) {
			if (i - coin >= 0) {
				dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1); 
			}
		}
	}
	return dp[amount] == amount + 1 ? -1 : dp[amount]; 
}
```

#### Python
```python
def coinChange(coins, amount):
	dp = [amount + 1] * (amount + 1)
	dp[0] = 0

	for i in range(1, amount + 1):
		for coin in coins:
			if (i - coin >= 0):
				dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)

	return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != amount + 1 else -1
```
