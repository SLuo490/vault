## Description
We have `n` jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from `startTime[i]` to `endTime[i]`, obtaining a profit of `profit[i]`.

You're given the `startTime`, `endTime` and `profit` arrays, return the maximum profit you can take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.

If you choose a job that ends at time `X` you will be able to start another job that starts at time `X`.

### Example 1:
![[Pasted image 20250310084549.png]]
```
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]
Output: 120
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth job. 
Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.
```
### Example 2:
![[Pasted image 20250310084644.png]]
```
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit = [20,20,100,70,60]
Output: 150
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job. 
Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.
```
### Example 3:
![[Pasted image 20250310084653.png]]
```
Input: startTime = [1,1,1], endTime = [2,3,4], profit = [5,6,4]
Output: 6
```
### Constraints:
- `1 <= startTime.length == endTime.length == profit.length <= 5 * 104`
- `1 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= 109`
- `1 <= profit[i] <= 104`

## Solutions

#### Solutions 1: Basic DP with Linear Search

Sort the jobs by end time, then for each job, we decide whether to include the job or not. When including the job, we find the latest non-overlapping job using linear search. 

```
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]

jobs = [[1, 3, 50], [2, 4, 10], [3, 5, 40], [3, 6, 70]]
	* job is already sorted by the end time

start at i = 1, so initialize dp[0] = jobs[0][2]
dp = [50]

---
jobs = [[1, 3, 50], [2, 4, 10], [3, 5, 40], [3, 6, 70]]
						-
i = 1
currProfit = 10

compare:
	[2, 4, 10] with [1, 3, 50] -->  3 > 2  (overlap)

currProfit = 10 + 0 = 10
dp[1] = max(10, 50) = 50
---
jobs = [[1, 3, 50], [2, 4, 10], [3, 5, 40], [3, 6, 70]]
						            -
i = 2
currProfit = 40

compare:
	[3, 5, 40] with [2, 4, 10] --> 4 > 2 (overlap)
	[3, 5, 40] with [1, 3, 50] --> 3 == 3 (no overlap)
		currProfit += 50 == 90

dp[2] = max(90, 50) = 90
---
jobs = [[1, 3, 50], [2, 4, 10], [3, 5, 40], [3, 6, 70]]
						                        -
i = 3
currProfit = 70

compare:
	[3, 6, 70] with [3, 5, 40] --> 5 > 3 (overlap)
	[3, 6, 70] with [2, 4, 10] --> 4 > 3 (overlap)
	[3, 6, 70] with [1, 3, 50] --> 3 == 3 (no overlap)
		currProfit += 50 == 120

dp[3] = max(120, 50) = 120

return dp[3]

```

**Time Complexity**: `O(n^2)`
**Space Complexity**: `O(n)`
### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
	int jobScheduling(vector<int>& startTime, vector<int>& endTime, vector<int>& profit) {
		int n = startTime.size(); 

		vector<vector<int>> jobs(n);
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			jobs[i] = {startTime[i], endTime[i], profit[i]}; 
		}

		// sort by end time
		sort(jobs.begin(), jobs.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
			return a[1] < b[1]; 
		});

		vector<int> dp(n); 
		dp[0] = jobs[0][2]; 

		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			int currProfit = jobs[i][2]; 

			// find the latest non overlap
			int latestNonOverlap = -1;
			for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
				if (jobs[j][1] <= jobs[i][0]) {
					latestNonOverlap = j;
					break;
				}
			}

			if (latestNonOverlap != -1) {
				currProfit += dp[latestNonOverlap]; 
			}

			dp[i] = max(currProfit, dp[i - 1]); 
		}
		
		return dp[n - 1]; 
	}
};
```

#### Solution 2: DP with Binary Search

Instead of using the linear search to find the latest non overlap for each job, we can utilize binary search instead. 

**Time Complexity**: `O(nlogn)`
**Space Complexity**: `O(n)`
### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int jobScheduling(vector<int>& startTime, vector<int>& endTime, vector<int>& profit) {
        int n = startTime.size(); 

        vector<vector<int>> jobs(n); 
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            jobs[i] = {startTime[i], endTime[i], profit[i]};
        }

        // sort by end time
        sort(jobs.begin(), jobs.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
            return a[1] < b[1]; 
        });

        vector<int> dp(n); 
        dp[0] = jobs[0][2];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int includeCurr = jobs[i][2]; 
            int latestNonOverlap = -1;

			// binary search
            int low = 0, high = i - 1;
            while (low <= high) {
                int mid = low + (high - low) / 2; 
                if (jobs[mid][1] <= jobs[i][0]) {
                    latestNonOverlap = mid; 
                    low = mid + 1; 
                } else {
                    high = mid - 1; 
                }
            }

            if (latestNonOverlap != -1) {
                includeCurr += dp[latestNonOverlap]; 
            }

            dp[i] = max(includeCurr, dp[i - 1]); 
        }
        
        return dp[n - 1]; 
    }
};
