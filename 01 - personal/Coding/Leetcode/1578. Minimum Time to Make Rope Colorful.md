## Description
Alice has `n` balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a **0-indexed** string `colors` where `colors[i]` is the color of the `ith` balloon.

Alice wants the rope to be **colorful**. She does not want **two consecutive balloons** to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it **colorful**. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `neededTime` where `neededTime[i]` is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the `ith` balloon from the rope.

Return _the **minimum time** Bob needs to make the rope **colorful**_.

### Example 1:
```
**Input:** colors = "abaac", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** In the above image, 'a' is blue, 'b' is red, and 'c' is green.
Bob can remove the blue balloon at index 2. This takes 3 seconds.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 3.
```

### Example 2:
```
**Input:** colors = "abc", neededTime = [1,2,3]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The rope is already colorful. Bob does not need to remove any balloons from the rope.
```

### Example 3: 
```
Input: colors = "aabaa", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Bob will remove the balloons at indices 0 and 4. Each balloons takes 1 second to remove.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 1 + 1 = 2.
```

### Constraints:
- `n == colors.length == neededTime.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= neededTime[i] <= 104`
- `colors` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Greedy

Check for adjacent colors, if there is an adjacent color, get the minimum cost between the two color's `neededTime`. Update the current color with the maximum cost between the color as we want to keep the maximum cost between the colors if there are three or more adjacent colors. 

```
Example: "aaa", [10, 4, 2]

"aaa" [10, 4, 2]
		   -
i = 1
totalCost += min(10, 4) = 4
neededTime[i] = max(10, 4) = 10

"aaa" [10, 10, 2]
			   -

i = 2
totalCost += min(10, 2) = 2
neededTime[i] = max(10, 2) = 10

return 6
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(string colors, vector<int>& neededTime) {
        int totalTime = 0; 

        for (int i = 1; i < neededTime.size(); i++) {
            if (colors[i] == colors[i - 1]) {
                totalTime += min(neededTime[i], neededTime[i - 1]); 
                neededTime[i] = max(neededTime[i], neededTime[i - 1]); 
            }
        }
        return totalTime; 
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, colors: str, neededTime: List[int]) -> int:
		totalTime = 0
		for i in range(1, len(neededTime)):
			if colors[i] == colors[i - 1]:
				totalTime += min(neededTime[i], neededTime[i - 1])
				neededTime = max(neededTime[i], neededTime[i - 1])
		return totalTime
```
