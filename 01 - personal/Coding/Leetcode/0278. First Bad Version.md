## Description
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1`

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Binary Search
Use binary search to find the first bad version. 
* If the number in `mid` is not a bad version, we can every number before `mid` will also not be bad, so move `left = mid + 1`
* If the number in `mid` is a bad version, we know that every number after `mid` will be bad, so we need to check the range before `mid`
#### C++
```cpp
// The API isBadVersion is defined for you.
// bool isBadVersion(int version);

class Solution {
public:
    int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int left = 0, right = n - 1; 
    
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; 

            if (!isBadVersion(mid)) {
                left = mid + 1; 
            } else {
                right = mid - 1; 
            }
        }
        return left; 
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, n - 1

        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2

            if not isBadVersion(mid):
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        
        return left
```
