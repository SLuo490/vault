## Description
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

### Example 1:
![[Pasted image 20250325094339.png]]
```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```

### Example 2:
![[Pasted image 20250325094341.png]]
```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
- `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
- All `Node.val` are **unique**.
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the BST.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: DFS

We can use a recursive approach that handles multiple scenarios by tracking the presence of the node `p` and `q` during tree traversal. 

**Recursive Logic**: 
- Base Case: `if (root == nullptr || root == p || root == q) return root;`
	- This base case handles three scenarios: 
		1. If we've reached the end of a branch (`nullptr`), return `nullptr`
		2. If the current node is either `p` or `q`, return that node
		3. This allows us to detect when we've found one of our target nodes
- Recursive Call:
```cpp
TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q); 
```
- Recursively search the left and right subtree of `p` and `q`
- Each recursive call returns: 
	- The node if `p` or `q` is found in the subtree
	- `nullptr` if neither node is found

**Result Determination**:
```cpp
if (!left) return right; 
if (!right) return left; 

return root; 
```
1. If `left` is `nullptr`:
	- Either both `p` or `q` are in the right subtree
	- Or the right subtree contains one of the nodes
	- So return the result from the right subtree
2. If `right` is `nullptr`:
	- Either both `p` or `q` are in the left subtree
	- Or the left subtree contains one of the nodes
	- So return the result from the left subtree
3. If both `left` and `right` are `non-nullptr`:
	- This means `p` and `q`are in different subtrees
	- The current `root` is their lowest common ancestor
	- So return the current `root`

**Time Complexity**: `O(N)`
**Space Complexity**: `O(H)`
#### C++
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (root == nullptr || root == p || root == q) return root; 

        TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q); 
        TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q); 

        if (!left) return right; 
        if (!right) return left; 

        return root; 
    }
};
```
