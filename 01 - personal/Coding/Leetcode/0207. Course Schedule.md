## Description
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
- All the pairs `prerequisites[i]` are **unique**.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: BFS + [[topological sort]] 

For this problem, we fundamentally need to check if there is a cycle in a directed graph. 
- Each course is a node in a directed graph
- Each prerequisite relationship creates a directed edge
- If a course A requires course B, we have an edge from B to A (B must be taken before A)

If there is a cycle in this graph, it creates an impossible situation: 
- Course A requires Course B
- Course B requires Course C
- Course C requires Course A
This forms a circular dependency where none of the course can be taken first, making it impossible to complete all courses. 

Here, [[topological sort]] can be used to detect this. 

This solution uses Kahn’s algorithm for topological sorting:
1. **Starting with “source” nodes** (courses with no prerequisites)
2. **Removes them** from the graph (adds them to our course schedule)
3. **Update the indegree** of their neighbors
4. **Repeats** with the newly available “source” nodes

If all courses can be processed this way, there’s a valid order to take all courses. If not, there must be a cycle preventing some courses from ever becoming “available”

>[!question]- How do we know our code won’t run a infinite loop if there is a cycle
>The queue is used to avoid infinite loop because the algorithm only adds courses whose indegree (count of the remaining prerequisites) has reached 0. 
>1. If there’s a cycle, some courses within that cycle will **never** have their indegree reduced to 0
>2. Eventually, the queue will become empty when no more courses with zero indegree remain

>[!summary]-
>We create a directed graph where the courses as nodes and the prerequisites as edges in the graph. 
>
>For each course with a prerequisite, we will increment its outgoing degree. 
>
>We traverse all in-degree with 0, reducing the in-degree of its out-degree node by 1, until all nodes have been traversed. 
>
>If all nodes has been traversed, it means that there is no cycle, so we completed all the courses; otherwise, we cannot complete all the courses

**Time Complexity**: `O(n + m)`
**Space Complexity**: `O(n + m)`

    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<vector<int>> adjList(numCourses); 
        vector<int> indegree(numCourses, 0); 

        for (vector<int> prereq : prerequisites) {
            int course = prereq[0]; 
            int prereqCourse = prereq[1]; 

            adjList[prereqCourse].push_back(course);
            indegree[course]++; 
        }

        queue<int> q; 
        for (int i = 0; i < indegree.size(); i++) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) {
                q.push(i); 
            }
        }

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int course = q.front(); 
            q.pop(); 

            numCourses--; 

            for (int neighbor : adjList[course]) {
                indegree[neighbor]--; 

                if (indegree[neighbor] == 0) {
                    q.push(neighbor); 
                }
            }
        }

        return numCourses == 0; 
    }
