## Description
Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

### Example 1:
![[Pasted image 20250311101512.png]]
```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

### Constraints:
- `n == height.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 105`

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Two Pointer

Utilize four pointers:
- `left` - start at the start of height
- `leftMax` - maximum height of the left side
- `right` - start at the end of height
- `rightMax` - maximum height of the right side

While traversing the height from the left and right side, if the `leftMax` is less than the `rightMax`, we increment `left` pointer, update the `leftMax` by comparing it with the current height. There will be a trapping rain water if the `leftMax` is greater than the current height of `left`. 

Likewise for the `right` pointer, we update the `rightMax` and if the `rightMax` is greater than the current height of `right` then there is water that is trapped. 

**Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
**Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

```
ex:
	 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11
	[0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
		   -                    -
	
	leftMax = 1
	left = 2

	water += leftMax - height[left] (1 - 0) = 1

	rightMax = 2
	right = 9

	water += rightMax - height[right] (2 - 1) = 1

	water = 2

	...
	
```
#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int trap(vector<int>& height) {
        int water = 0, left = 0, right = height.size() - 1;
        int leftMax = height[left]; 
        int rightMax = height[right]; 

        while (left < right) {
            if (leftMax < rightMax) {
                left++; 
                leftMax = max(leftMax, height[left]); 
                water += leftMax - height[left]; 
            } else {
                right--; 
                rightMax = max(rightMax, height[right]); 
                water += rightMax - height[right]; 
            }
        }
        return water; 
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right, water = 0, len(height) - 1, 0
        leftMax, rightMax = height[left], height[right]

        while left < right:
            if leftMax < rightMax:
                left += 1
                leftMax = max(leftMax, height[left])
                water += leftMax - height[left]
            else:
                right -= 1
                rightMax = max(rightMax, height[right])
                water += rightMax - height[right]
        
        return water
```
