## Description
Given a list of `accounts` where each element `accounts[i]` is a list of strings, where the first element `accounts[i][0]` is a name, and the rest of the elements are **emails** representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails **in sorted order**. The accounts themselves can be returned in **any order**.

### Example 1:
```
Input: accounts = [["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com"],["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john00@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
Output: [["John","john00@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com","johnsmith@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
Explanation:
The first and second John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com".
The third John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.
We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: accounts = [["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe3@m.co","Gabe1@m.co"],["Kevin","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co","Kevin0@m.co"],["Ethan","Ethan5@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan0@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo3@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo0@m.co"],["Fern","Fern5@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern0@m.co"]]
Output: [["Ethan","Ethan0@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan5@m.co"],["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe1@m.co","Gabe3@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo0@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo3@m.co"],["Kevin","Kevin0@m.co","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co"],["Fern","Fern0@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern5@m.co"]]
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= accounts.length <= 1000`
- `2 <= accounts[i].length <= 10`
- `1 <= accounts[i][j].length <= 30`
- `accounts[i][0]` consists of English letters.
- `accounts[i][j] (for j > 0)` is a valid email.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Hash Table + Sorting

1.  **Model as Graph:**
    * Think of each unique email address as a point (node).
    * Draw lines (edges) connecting emails that appear together in the *same* input account.
    * Use a map (`unordered_map`) to store these connections (`email` -> `list of connected emails`).

2.  **Build Connections:**
    * Go through each input account.
    * For each account, connect its *first* email to all its *other* emails in the map (make sure connections go both ways).

3.  **Find Groups (DFS):**
    * Use Depth First Search (DFS) to explore connected groups of emails.
    * Keep a `visited` set to track which emails you've already processed.
    * When DFS explores from an email, it finds all emails reachable via the connection lines (all emails belonging to one person).

4.  **Merge & Sort:**
    * Iterate through the original accounts again.
    * If an account's first email is *not* in the `visited` set:
        * It's the start of a new person's emails.
        * Add the account `name` to a temporary list.
        * Run DFS starting from that first email to find and add *all* connected emails to the list.
        * **Sort** the emails in the temporary list alphabetically.
        * Add this final list (`[name, sorted_email1, sorted_email2, ...]`) to your results.
    * If the first email *was* already visited, skip it (it's part of a group already found).

5.  **Return** the collected results.

**Time Complexity:** `O(N * K log(N * K))` where N is the number of accounts and K is the maximum number of emails in a single account.
    * Building the graph takes O(N * K) time as we iterate through all emails.
    * DFS visits each edge and node (email) once, contributing O(N * K).
    * Sorting the emails in each merged component dominates. In the worst case, all emails might belong to one person (N*K emails). Sorting takes O(M log M), where M is the number of emails in the component. The total sorting time across all components is bounded by O(A log A), where A is the total number of emails (sum of all K across N accounts, roughly N*K).
**Space Complexity:** `O(N * K)`
    * The `accountsList` (graph) and `visited` set can store up to O(N * K) unique emails and edges in the worst case.
    * The recursion depth of DFS can also go up to O(N * K) in the worst case (a single chain of emails).
    * The `res` vector also stores all emails, contributing O(N * K).

    unordered_map<string, vector<string>> accountsList; 
    unordered_set<string> visited; 

    void dfs(vector<string>& mergeAccount, string email) {
        visited.insert(email); 
        mergeAccount.push_back(email); 

        for (string neighbor : accountsList[email]) {
            if (visited.find(neighbor) == visited.end()) {
                dfs(mergeAccount, neighbor);
            }
        }
    }

    vector<vector<string>> accountsMerge(vector<vector<string>>& accounts) {
        for (int i = 0; i < accounts.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 2; j < accounts[i].size(); j++) {
                accountsList[accounts[i][1]].push_back(accounts[i][j]); 
                accountsList[accounts[i][j]].push_back(accounts[i][1]); 
            }
        }

        vector<vector<string>> res;
        for (vector<string> account : accounts) {
            string accountName = account[0]; 
            string accountFirstEmail = account[1]; 

            vector<string> mergeAccount; 
            
            // dfs
            if (visited.find(accountFirstEmail) == visited.end()) {
                mergeAccount.push_back(accountName); 
                dfs(mergeAccount, accountFirstEmail); 
                sort(mergeAccount.begin() + 1, mergeAccount.end()); 
                res.push_back(mergeAccount); 
            }
        }

        return res; 
    }
};
